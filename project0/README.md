# Project 0

I have created this website, having in mind to build a website that offers images and videos. The user will need to create an account to benefit 
of the most advanced features that the website offers. There are three kind of subscriptions: daily, monthly and yearly. all of them have a different price and differe features 
depending on the subcription choosen, the user will benefit of different service.

First page is the index.
Second page is the JOIN US. html
Third page is the MEMBERSHIP PRICE LIST.html
Fourth page is the IMAGE.html
Fifth page is the LOG IN.html

all of the pages are linked to each other, and they include: 
- one list (ordered or unordered)
- one table

- one stylesheet file
- five different CSS properties
- five different types of CSS selectors
- 1 #id selector
- 1 .class selector
